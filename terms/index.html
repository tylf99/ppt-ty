                    charge you a Membership Fee. &nbsp;Refunds for the membership are outlined below in the refund policy.
                    &nbsp;You authorize Clickview Interactive LLC to charge you the Membership Fee starting on the Effective
                    Date, recurring upon the expiration date of each Term thereafter until you cancel your Membership
                    agreement with PayPer Trail / Clickview Interactive LLC. &nbsp;My initiating your Membership, you
                    authorize Clickview Interactive LLC to initiate payment transactions for payment methods provided by
                    you, credit card, debit card, PayPal or bank deposit. &nbsp;</p> <p>You authorize Clickview Interactive LLC and its third-party billing-services provider to initiate
                    debit/credit entries to the bank deposit account or credit card You provided for the cost of the

                    fee, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your membership will be canceled.
                    If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new
                    membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful
                    charge.</p> <p>UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU
                    UNDERSTAND YOUR MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU,
                    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES,
                    USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.</p> <h3>Cancelation and Refund Policy:</h3> <h4>Cancelation </h4> <p>You can cancel your account at anytime by clicking the cancel button located in the billing section
                    of your account. If you cancel, your account will remain active until the end of your current
                    billing cycle, at which point your account will be paused and billing profile deleted.&nbsp;</p> <p>If our system administrators detect abuse or fraud, your account may be suspended or terminated,
                    which in addition to locking the account will pause your billing profile, preventing any further
                    charges. If you believe this has been done in error, please contact info@paypertrail.com&nbsp;</p> <h4>Refund</h4> <p>As we provide users with a risk free 7-day trial, we do not provide refunds.&nbsp;</p> <p>PayPer Trail is committed to providing our customers with the best level of service.

                    including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement
                    costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict
                    liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using
                    the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product,
                    including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any

                    or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some
                    states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential
                    or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the
                    maximum extent permitted by law.</p> <h3>INDEMNIFICATION</h3> <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Clickview Interactive LLC and our parent,

                    providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand,
                    including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach
                    of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any
                    law or the rights of a third-party.</p> <h3>SEVERABILITY</h3> <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or
                    unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
                    applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of
                    Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining
                    provisions.</p> <h3>Business uses of our Services&nbsp;</h3> <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will
                    hold harmless and indemnify PayPer Trail and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from

                    terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments,
                    litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.</p> <h3>TERMINATION</h3> <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive
                    the termination of this agreement for all purposes.</p> <p>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may
                    terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our
                    Services.</p> <p>If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or
                    provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice
                    and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or
                    accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).</p>

                    order to reinstate the account and subscribed services.</p> <h3>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3> <p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not
                    constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p> <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to
